# Western Quantum Club 

Quantum computing is a new computing paradigm that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to perform certain computations exponentially faster than classical computers.

At Western's Quantum Computing club, we plan to explore the potential applications of this technology, including cryptography, machine learning, optimization, and simulation of quantum systems by using IBM's open-sourced quantum computing software, [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/).
